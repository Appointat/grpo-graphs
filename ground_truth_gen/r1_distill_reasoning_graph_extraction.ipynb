      "The number of major languages in the world is not fixed and depends on the criteria used (e.g., speaker count, regional influence, official status). However, common estimates suggest:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Top 20–30 Languages**: Often identified by **native/total speakers** (e.g., Ethnologue lists **23 languages** with over 50 million native speakers).  \n",
      "   Examples: Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, English, Hindi, Arabic, Bengali, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, French, German, Swahili, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **UN Official Languages**: 6 languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish) are designated for global diplomacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Regional Significance**: Languages like Swahili (Africa) or Indonesian (Southeast Asia) are major in specific regions, even with fewer global speakers.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Total Speakers**: Including second-language users, languages like English (~1.5 billion total speakers) and French (~300 million) rank highly.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Factors**:  \n",
      "- **Native speakers**: Mandarin Chinese leads with ~1 billion.  \n",
      "- **Global influence**: English dominates in international business/science.  \n",
      "- **Lingua franca**: Arabic, Hindi-Urdu, or Malay/Indonesian serve large, diverse populations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**: While definitions vary, **20–30 languages** are typically considered \"major\" based on speaker numbers, geographic spread, and sociopolitical impact. Over 200 languages have ≥1 million speakers, but \"major\" usually refers to those with broader global or regional significance.\n",
      "<think>\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, so the user is asking about how many major languages there are in the world. Hmm, let's think about this. First, I need to clarify what counts as a \"major\" language. There's no strict definition, but usually, people consider factors like the number of native speakers, the number of total speakers, the geographical distribution, and the language's influence in international contexts like business, politics, or culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, so maybe start by looking at the number of speakers. Languages like Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, English, Hindi, Arabic, and others come to mind because they have hundreds of millions of speakers. But wait, some sources may categorize some languages differently. For example, Arabic has many dialects, some of which are mutually unintelligible, so should they be considered separate languages or dialects under the Arabic umbrella? That could affect the count.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, there's the question of second-language speakers. English, for instance, is widely spoken as a second language around the world, so its total number of speakers is huge. Similarly, French is an official language in many countries, especially in Africa, so even if native speakers aren't the majority, the total number including second-language speakers could be substantial. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then there are languages that are significant in specific regions. Swahili in East Africa, for example, is a lingua franca for many countries there. Similarly, Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia) is widely spoken in Indonesia, a country with a large population. So even though their global speaker count might not be as high as Mandarin or English, their regional importance makes them major in their areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another angle is official status. The United Nations has six official languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish. Those are definitely major by that measure. But does that cover all major languages? Probably not, because there are languages with more speakers than some of these. For example, Hindi has a lot more speakers than French, but it's not a UN official language. But Hindi is mostly concentrated in India, whereas French is official in many countries. So maybe political and international influence plays a role here.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also think about linguistic diversity. Ethnologue, which is a well-known resource on languages, lists about 7,000 living languages. But the vast majority of these have very few speakers. So when we talk about \"major\" languages, we're probably focusing on those with at least millions of speakers. The cutoff might be arbitrary. Some sources might list the top 20 or 30 languages by speaker numbers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me recall some numbers. Mandarin Chinese has around 1 billion native speakers. Spanish and English each have hundreds of millions. Then Hindi, Bengali, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, etc. Maybe around 20 languages have over 50 million speakers. Then there are others with fewer speakers but significant regional importance. So if someone is asking about major languages, maybe around 20 to 30 would be a reasonable estimate. But again, it depends on the criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, sometimes people refer to major languages as those that have a certain level of institutional support, like being used in education, government, and media. In that case, even languages with fewer speakers but official status in a country could be considered major. However, the user's question is about the world as a whole, so perhaps focusing on languages with a large number of speakers and global influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to check if there's a commonly accepted number. I remember reading that there are about 200 languages with over a million speakers. But that would be more than \"major\". The user probably doesn't need the full list but a concise answer. So maybe condensing to a range based on common definitions. For example, between 20 to 30 languages are considered major based on their speaker numbers and global influence. Often cited are the top 10, 20, or 23 (like the number with more than 50 million speakers according to Ethnologue). \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me think. According to Ethnologue's 2023 data, there are about 23 languages with at least 50 million native speakers, and if we include second-language speakers, the number of total speakers would be higher. But some languages might have fewer native speakers but more total speakers. So depending on whether we count native or total, the list changes. English, for example, has around 375 million native speakers but over a billion total speakers. Similarly, French has about 80 million native but over 200 million total. \n",
      "\n",
      "So if the criteria is total speakers, English is number one, then Mandarin because of the native speakers, even though second-language isn't as high. Then Hindi, Spanish, etc. Maybe there are around 20-25 languages that surpass a certain threshold, like 100 million speakers total. But again, the exact number might vary. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider writing systems and standardization. Some languages might be widely spoken but not have a standardized written form, which might affect their classification as major. But perhaps that's too technical for the general answer the user might be seeking. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another factor is whether the language is a lingua franca. For example, Swahili in East Africa, Urdu in Pakistan and parts of India, Indonesian in Southeast Asia. These might not have the highest speaker numbers globally but are crucial in their regions, making them major in a regional context. However, the user's question is about the world, so maybe regional major languages add to the count but aren't the main focus. \n",
      "\n",
      "So synthesizing all this, the answer probably needs to state that while the exact number depends on criteria, typically around 20 to 30 languages are considered major based on factors like number of speakers, global influence, and official status. Also mention that estimates often range between 20 and 30, sometimes mentioning specific numbers like 23 (from Ethnologue's 50+ million native speakers) or up to 200 if considering a million speakers as the threshold. But the key is to clarify that \"major\" is subjective. \n",
      "\n",
      "So in the answer, first explain that there's no exact number, then provide the common estimates based on speaker count, mention the UN languages perhaps, note the difference between native and total speakers, and maybe list some examples. Make sure to convey that depending on the criteria, the number can vary, but the common answer is around 20-30.\n",

    "1. 配置与初始化\n",
    "使用tiktoken库计算文本的token数量\n",
    "设置分块参数：最大token数(1500)和重叠token数(150)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 文本处理功能\n",
    "文本分割：将长文本按照Markdown标题分块，并确保每块不超过token限制\n",
    "滑动窗口：对超长段落使用重叠滑动窗口技术分割，保证语义连贯性\n",
    "文章摘要：从文章头部提取摘要信息\n",
    "\n",
    "3. AI模型交互\n",
    "构建提示模板，包含文章摘要、当前文本块和指令\n",
    "调用DeepSeek R1模型API，提取知识图谱\n",
    "收集模型输出和推理过程\n",
    "\n",
    "4. 数据处理与存储\n",
    "将所有处理结果以结构化形式收集\n",
    "保存为CSV格式，包含文件名、块索引、标题、原文、摘要、提示、API输出和推理过程\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 主要流程\n",
    "遍历data_raw目录中的所有Markdown文件\n",
    "将每个文件分割成合适大小的文本块\n",
    "对每个文本块构建提示并调用AI模型\n",
    "收集结果并保存为训练数据集\n",
    "该代码特别适合用于构建知识图谱训练数据集，或分析AI模型的推理能力。\n",
